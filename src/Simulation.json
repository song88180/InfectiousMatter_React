The Infected agents are contagious, and if they bump into Susceptible (black border) agents, there is a chance they'll transmit the disease. Eventually, Infected organisms will recover and develop resistance to the disease. You'll see these Recovered agents with a green border in the simulation. We would call this, then, an Agent Based version of a traditional Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered (SEIR) model.",
